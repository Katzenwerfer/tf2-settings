// How to setup external audio:
// - Download a virtual audio cable. I recommend either 'VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device' or 'VB-Audio Hi-Fi Cable' which are both in this limk --> https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
// - Install (duh)
// - Make sure input and output virtual devices
// - Set your system's default recording device to the virtual cable
// - Set your music's audio to output to the virtual cable input device
// - In TF2, type snd_restart and run script
