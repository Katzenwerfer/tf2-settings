# TF2-settings

My Team Fortress 2 settings

## Requirements:

- [mastercomfig](https://mastercomfig.com/) [**NONE** preset preferably]

## It includes:

- Class CFGs
- My masterconfig settings
- A list of mods (and some with little modifications)
- A list of maps I like to use

## Launch arguments

`-high -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noquicktime`
  
You can also add this [extra arguments](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector/issues/331#:~:text=to%20API%20changes.-,Temporary%20fix%3A,-Shut%20down%20steam) if you want to use [TF2 Bot Detector](https://github.com/PazerOP/tf2_bot_detector) without having to launch TF2 from the app

## Notes


I would recommend installing everything inside the `custom` folder instead of the game's `cfg` folder

```
─── Team Fortress 2
    └── tf
        └── custom
            ├── [FOLDER]
            │   └── cfg
            │       └── {Install CFGs here}
            └── {Install mods from config here}
```
